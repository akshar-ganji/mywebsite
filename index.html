      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio Website</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Akshar Ganji</strong>, a passionate and curious individual with a love for learning and creativity. I'm currently diving into the world of <strong>web development</strong>, and this portfolio is my first step into bringing ideas to life online. When I'm not exploring new coding concepts, you'll often find me getting lost in a playlist full of my <strong>favorite music</strong>. I also enjoy reading, especially topics that expand my thinking, and I love playing <strong>online games</strong>—they’re not just fun but also keep my mind sharp and strategic. And yes, I have a big sweet tooth—desserts are my weakness! I'm excited to grow, learn new skills, and share my journey here with you. <strong>Thanks for visiting!</strong></p>        
      <p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!</p>
